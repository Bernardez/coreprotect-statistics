# The frontend of the project
This part of the project needs to be served over the internet using your favorite HTTP server.  
There should be no special configuration needed for the HTTP server.

### Configuration
In the folder `statics` there is a file called `config.json`. Please edit this file to add your own page header and API url. 

### Optional
You can edit the icons in the `statics` directory to have your own style icon.
